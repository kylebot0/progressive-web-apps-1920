## Description üìù
This project uses the SpaceX API to display their rockets, missions, launches, capsules and ships. It has certain overview pages and detailpages. The detailpages feature all the extra content when you search for it. To get the different kind of overview pages, the app calls to a different api to get the data. It renders the pages using EJS on the server. Next to that the pages are fully optimized for performance and gets a 100 score in audits.

## Installing üîç
To install this application and enter the repo write the following into your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/kylebot0/web-app-from-scratch-1920.git && cd web-app-from-scratch-1920
```

Because this project uses different modules, you'll have to npm install to get the different dependecies
```
npm install
```
To build all the modules, run
```
npm run watch
```

### Packages and Technologies
This project makes use of the following packages and technologies:

  * Webpack

## API üêí
The data used throughout the application is from the SpaceX API ```https://api.spacexdata.com/v3```.
It is a free public api with no rate limit, and can be called as many times as you want.

Because i call the API, from different links the data can vary.
The data has i.e. the following structure:
```javascript
{
    "mission_name": "Iridium NEXT",
    "mission_id": "F3364BF",
    "manufacturers": [
      "Orbital ATK"
    ],
    "payload_ids": [
      "Iridium NEXT 1",
      "Iridium NEXT 2",
      "Iridium NEXT 3",
      "Iridium NEXT 4",
      "Iridium NEXT 5",
      "Iridium NEXT 6",
      "Iridium NEXT 7"
    ],
  },
```

If you want to look at the docs from the API, and or are interested in easily seeing how it works. 
SpaceX uses postman for that.

- [x] Add critical rendering path
- [x] Use gzip compression
- [x] Image reflow and lazy loading of images for slow networks
- [x] Browser caching
- [x] Cache caching
- [x] Add minifying with webpack
